# TIAsm
Zacks TI-84 Plus CE assembly playthings.

# Building
Requires [SPASM-ng](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng) to build.

Run `./build.sh` to build.  The out folder will contain the generated `.8xp`
files.

You can transfer those to your calculator with [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw)
or run them in an emulator.  I used [CEmu](https://github.com/CE-Programming/cemu).
